# The repos below are used during the build process, most of these will be going away very soon
# when we have everything packaged up, but for now they're necessary. Yes it's not ideal, they could
# be submodules, but submodules are harder for new contributors to deal with and this stuff won't be around
# much longer anyway.
#
# Note that the branch names can be tags as well, and in cases where a repo does not have proper versions
# upstream, we fork and apply our own in the form of openhd1, openhd2, etc, just to ensure that
# a particular version is always used for a build.
